# Contributing
Since we consider this an iterative project, we're always looking to add,
improve, or refactor features. Code is never "done". As a result, these
guidelines are subject to change. Please check back regularly for changes
to our workflow and policies.

### Git Workflow
- Implement new features in their own separate branch. Unless there is a
compelling reason, always branch from master.
- All changes to master must be made with a pull request and a code review
- Log all technical decisions that deviate from the story within the pull 
request if applicable
- When pulling changes, use rebase `-r` 

### Code Conventions
- Follow all conventions inside the ESLint configuration
- Use comments sparingly, instead opting to focus on writing descriptive code
- Update `.gitignore` to keep repository environment agnostic
- Keep dependencies to a minimum

### Team Standards
- Attend biweekly sprints with iteration planning meetings at the start and 
retrospective at the end
- Accept constructive criticism
- Be approachable and willing to help
- Voice your ideas no matter how insignificant you think they might be
- Discuss disagreements and reach a consensus

### Our Values
Our project is categorized by the following values and goals
- To bring as many people together through social gaming as possible
- To create a high quality gameplay experience for our users
- To maintain a high level of integrity within our games
- To inspire everyone to both artistically and creatively

### Code of Conduct
Do not abuse, harass, or engage in any behavior that would be considered 
unacceptable. This applies in all project spaces. Instances of abusive, 
harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting 
the project team at dz1358@nyu.edu.
