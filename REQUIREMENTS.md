## End-user Observation
This project is built for younger people seeking to relieve the problem of 
finding something fun, easy, convenient, and most importantly *free* to do 
with your friends. Drawing With Friends is the perfect solution to this 
dilemma - join your friends in a private room with a shareable link 
generated by our application, and draw away!

### All About John
John is a sophomore in college in Maryland enjoys hanging out with his friends, 
but they only have so many fun things to do - their age keeps them from going 
out to bars and clubs, their college town shuts down pretty early, and they 
all don't have money to burn. Boredom is often prevalent in his community, 
and sometimes trekking board games across campus is a hassle. Sometimes his 
friends will whip out some Jackbox games, but they've gotten old from weekly 
game nights a semester ago. Buying new Jackbox Party packs or similar games 
costs money that they don't have. 

Now that he and his friends are taking more complex courses and getting jobs 
and internships, it has become difficult to meet up in person. 

Drawing With Friends would offer an easy and convenient answer to their 
struggle, and John and his friends would be able to join each other online 
from the comfort of their own rooms! John and his friends can sit down and 
play a quick game to iron out the stress of the semester by indulging in a 
nostalgic classic game.
